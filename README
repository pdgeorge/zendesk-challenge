Instructions for proper usage of this program:
Ensure the correct credentials are utilised at the top of the file.

Ruby needs to be installed and able to run.

There is no required gems. test/unit, net/http and json are all default gems for Ruby.

I did regular testing, which allowed me to find errors like the "print entry 0 one hundred times" error mentioned in notes.
It also allowed me to find the loop difference between msys and Powershell as well as find a fix. This is also mentioned in notes.
In my testing, I *believe* I put in proper testing, however I am still new to unit testing and know I have a lot to learn.

Usage should be fairly straight forward:
1) User enters credentials. Previous versions stored *a* password, however that was a sacrificial password for fast testing while the repository was private. The password has been changed since then.
On making the repository public, security matters more than convenience.
2) Follow the menu options. If numbers outside of requested options are entered, it will re-prompt.
