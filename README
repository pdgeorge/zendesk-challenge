Instructions for proper usage of this program:
Ensure the correct credentials are utilised at the top of the file.
Ensure using the password supplied in the email received from Michael George

Ruby needs to be installed and able to run.

There is no required gems to install. test/unit, net/http, json, openssl and base64 are all default gems for Ruby.

I did regular testing, which allowed me to find errors like the "print entry 0 one hundred times" error mentioned in notes.
It also allowed me to find the loop difference between msys and Powershell as well as find a fix. This is also mentioned in notes.
In my testing, I *believe* I put in proper testing, however I am still new to unit testing and know I have a lot to learn.
This was my first real exploration in to a number of these areas, so it was a great learning opportunity so far and I would love to learn more.

The addition of password saving etc. was not intended as an extra feature, more an attempt to make life easier for the code reviewer.

Usage should be fairly straight forward:
1) Ensure all files are downloaded and placed in the same folder. The most crucial files are: "zendesk_challenge.rb" "private.pem" and "credentials.txt"
2) User chooses to either allow the program to load from stored credentials, or the user can choose to enter the credentials themselves if the credentials load incorrectly.
3) Follow the menu options. If numbers outside of requested options are entered, it will re-prompt.
