Loops with 'gets' within them react differently in mingw/msys/etc. vs Powershell.
In Powershell, they work as you would expect, however in msys they store the buffer until after the user has made all inputs.
This is the reason for the STDOUT.flush inclusions. This is also mentioned in the Github push.

Bulk pushed data had requester_id and assignee_id overwritten when pulled.
Weird note: When searching via search_integer, priority appears, however when searching via search_string, priority appears as nul. Despite using the same print_results method.
Ignore above note: That was my sleep deprived brain unable to recognise it was printing entry 0, one hundred times.
