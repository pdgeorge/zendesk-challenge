Loops with 'gets' within them react differently in mingw/msys/etc. vs Powershell.
In Powershell, they work as you would expect, however in msys they store the buffer until after the user has made all inputs.

Bulk pushed data had requester_id and assignee_id overwritten when pulled.
Weird note: When searching via search_integer, priority appears, however when searching via search_string, priority appears as nul. Despite using the same print_results method.
Ignore above note: That was my 2am sleep deprived brain unable to recognise it was printing entry 0, one hundred times. That error was fixed within a few minutes however the next push wasn't until the next day.
