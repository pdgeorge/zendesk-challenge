Instructions for proper usage of this program:
Ensure the correct credentials are utilised at the top of the file.
Ensure using the password supplied in the email received from Michael George and/or the private.pem file from the same email is downloaded.

Usage should be fairly straight forward:
1) Ensure all files are downloaded and placed in the same folder. The most crucial files are: "zendesk_challenge.rb" "private.pem" (from the above mentioned email) and "credentials.txt"
2) When all files are downloaded and placed in the same folder, navigate through terminal to the folder of choice and run "ruby zendesk_challenge.rb"
3) The user chooses to either allow the program to load from stored credentials (option 1), or the user can choose to enter the credentials themselves (option 2).
4) Follow the menu options to do as suggested.

Notes can be found in notes.txt
Notes are a mix of notes to the marker explaining why I did one thing compared to another, as well as minor notes to myself as quick reference.

The addition of password saving etc. was not intended as an extra feature, more an attempt to make life easier for the code reviewer.
